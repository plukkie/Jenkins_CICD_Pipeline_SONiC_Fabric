# CI/CD pipeline for a datacenter network fabric
This repo helps you setup a CI/CD pipeline for a datacenter fabric. 
Network staging will be validated to a GNS3 test fabric. 
If connectivity tests are succesful, the configuration can be deployed to the prod fabric.
It is a so called closed loop deployment.
